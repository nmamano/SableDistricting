To load a graph from the code, simply call GraphLoader.load(graphName).
E.g.: GraphLoader.load("DC")

The only thing in the code you may need to change is the value of the variable
GRAPHS_FOLDER in the GraphLoader class, which should be the relative path from
where the program is run (or the absolute path) to the folder 'graphs/' with the graphs

Each graph should have a unique name, and it should be in a subfolder with the same name.
E.g.: graphs/DC/ for the graph "DC"

Files within a subfolder are distinguished by the extension:

DC.tmp: source graph file as downloaded from http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/data/tiger/
(make sure the name of the folder and file match, e.g., graphs/DC/DC.tmp)

DC.txt: cleaned-up graph file from the .tmp file:
- only biggest connected component
- simplified coordinates
- stripped of extra metadata
This file is automatically generated (if it doesn't already exist)
when GraphLoader.load("DC") is called. Once this file has been generated,
the (bigger) .tmp file can be deleted.

DC.info: automatically generated file with basic info about the cleaned graph,
such as number of nodes and edges
